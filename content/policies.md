**Location**:  | CLS   | 
**Time**: | T and TH  | 
**Instructor**: | Dr. Tad Dallas (tdallas@mailbox.sc.edu) | 
**Office**: | 601 EWS (Coker is the main building, and EWS is the other side of the elevators) | 
**Drop-in hours**: |  Th from 2:30 - 4:20pm  | 



### Course Overview:

This course will familiarize students with the central concepts of theoretical ecology, providing an underlying mathematical basis to the processes that govern natural systems. Emphasis will be placed on population and community ecology, exploring (mostly) discrete time models of population and community dynamics, with clear links to empirical data. 





### Course Goals:

Over the course, it is expected that students gain
* an understanding of theoretical concepts and their relationship to natural systems
* a confidence around applying analytical and simulation based approaches to ecological data
* an ability to read and understand primary literature 





### Grading

There will be a total of 500 points, consisting of 5 assignments, some attendance/participation points, and a final project. 



**Undergraduate-level grading**

| -- |  ---  | :---: |
| Assignments | 5 x 50 | 250 |
| Attendance/Participation | 75 | 75 |
| Final exam | 50 | 50 |



**Graduate-level grading**

  <span></span>     | <span></span> | <span></span> 
 --------|------| -----------
| **Item** | **Points** | **Total** |
| -- |  ---  | :---: |
| Assignments | 5 x 30 | 150 |
| Attendance/Participation | 75 | 75 |
| Project | 100 | 100 |
| Final exam | 50 | 50 |






**Assignments**: 

All assignments are due by immediately before the start of class on the day indicated. Assignments should be submitted as instructed. Assignments are not collaborative, and I expect that each student will complete the assignment independently. 



**Late Assignments**: 

All assignments are expected to be electronically submitted by the due date. I will not accept any assignment that is submitted after the deadline and the assignment will receive the grade of 0. This course is an upper-level class and you are expected to work at the appropriate level and be responsible for your work. All deadlines are posted with the syllabus or any changes will be announced ahead of time.










**Attendance**: 

Much of the material presented will not be available if you aren't in class to hear it. You should come to class. If you do not, you may struggle. Part of the class will be discussing relevant papers. If you do not participate in paper discussions, clearly demonstrating that you have read and understand the nuances of the work, this will affect your grade. Attendance and participation will be worth 75 points. 






**Project**: 

Graduate researchers in the course will do a course-long project. The project will be a demonstration of your learning and allow you to use the new tools and concepts you have acquired in the course. This could take many forms, including the analysis of a commonly used model in ecology, a review of some application of theory and empirical data (e.g., the theory of species-area relationships), and many others. 

More information on the final project and its components are provided at the bottom of this document. The three core parts are 1) the proposal, 2) the implementation, and 3) the presentation

_The project is worth 100 points_







**Final exam**:

The final exam will be worth 50 points, consisting of a mixture of coding and high-level conceptual questions.







### Academic honesty

Cooperation has a limit. You should not copy your code or answers directly with other students. Feel free to discuss the problems with others, but write your own solutions. Penalties for cheating are severe -- they range from a zero grade for the assignment or exam up to dismissal from the University, for a second offense. Rather than copying someone else's work, ask for help. You are not alone in this course! If you invest the time to learn the material and complete the projects, you won't need to copy any answers.

You are expected to practice the highest possible standards of academic integrity. Any deviation from this expectation will result in a minimum academic penalty of your failing the assignment, and will result in additional disciplinary measures. This includes improper citation of sources, using another student's work, and any other form of academic misrepresentation.

The first tenet of the Carolinian Creed is, "I will practice personal and academic integrity."



### Diversity and inclusion

The university is committed to a campus environment that is inclusive, safe, and respectful for all persons, and one that fully embraces the Carolinian Creed. To that end, all course activities will be conducted in an atmosphere of friendly participation and interaction among colleagues, recognizing and appreciating the unique experiences, background, and point of view each student brings. You are expected at all times to apply the highest academic standards to this course and to treat others with dignity and respect.

### Accessibility, disability, and triggers 

I am committed to ensuring course accessibility for all students. If you have a documented disability and expect reasonable accommodation to complete course requirements, please notify me at least one week before accommodation is needed. Please also provide SDRC (https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_disability_resource_center/) documentation to me before requesting accommodation. Likewise, if you are aware of cognitive or emotional triggers that could disrupt your intellectual or mental health, please let me know so that I can be aware in terms of course content. 
Diversity, Ethics, and the Carolinian Creed [credit to Dr. David Moscowitz]
This course works to foster a climate free of harassment and discrimination, and it values the contributions of all forms of diversity. The decision to enter university and pursue advanced study is a choice that entails commitment to personal ethics expressed in the Carolinian Creed (www.sa.sc.edu/creed): "I will discourage bigotry, while striving to learn from differences in people, ideas and opinions." Likewise, the Student Code of Conduct (STAF 6.26 (http://www.sc.edu/policies/ppm/staf626.pdf) stresses, "The University of South Carolina strives to maintain an educational community that fosters the development of students who are ethical, civil and responsible persons." 


### Title IX and gendered pronouns 

This course affirms equality and respect for all gendered identities and expressions. Please don't hesitate to correct me regarding your preferred gender pronoun and/or name if different from what is indicated on the official class roster. Likewise, I am committed to nurturing an environment free from discrimination and harassment. Consistent with Title IX policy, please be aware that I as a responsible employee am obligated to report information that you provide to me about a situation involving sexual harassment or assault. 




### Disability services

Student Disability Resource Center (http://www.sa.sc.edu/sds/): The Student Disability Resource Center (SDRC) empowers students to manage challenges and limitations imposed by disabilities. Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact me to discuss the logistics of any accommodations needed to fulfill course requirements (within the first week of the semester). In order to receive reasonable accommodations from me, you must be registered with the Student Disability Resource Center (1705 College Street, Close-Hipp Suite 102, Columbia, SC 29208, 803-777-6142). Any student with a documented disability should contact the SDRC to make arrangements for appropriate accommodations.

### Student Success Center

Counseling Services (https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_health_services/medical-services/counseling-and-psychiatry/index.php): The University offers counseling and crisis services as well as outreach services, self-help, and frequently asked questions.


### Mental Health

If stress is impacting you or getting in the way of your ability to do your schoolwork, maintain relationships, eat, sleep, or enjoy yourself, please reach out to any of our mental health resources. Counseling & Psychiatry offers individual and group counseling and psychiatric services. You can schedule an appointment at (803) 777-5223 or on MyHealthSpace.

### Interpersonal Violence

Interpersonal violence - including sexual harassment, relationship violence, sexual assault, and stalking - is prohibited at UofSC. Faculty, staff, and administrators encourage anyone experiencing interpersonal violence to speak with someone, so they can get the necessary support and UofSC can respond appropriately. If you or someone you know has been or is currently impacted by interpersonal violence, you can find the appropriate resources at the Stop Interpersonal Violence (http://www.sc.edu/stopsexualassault) website.
